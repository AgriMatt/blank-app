## Team Name: The Crafty Cows

### Tool Name: Downer Cow Risk Rating

### Use Case
Downer Cow Syndrome refers to a cow which cannot stand of own accord, owing to disease, tramaua or othe external factor. It is possible to calculate a paddock's risk of having cows develop downer syndrome based on soil paramters and hours of cloud cover. A paddock can be rated as being at high, medium or low of having animals develop the disability.

### Delivery Method
The risk rating will be delivered as a colour overlay to satellite map imagery, which includes paddock delineation. The following colors will be used to denote the risk rating:

* RED for a HIGH rating
* ORANGE for a MEDIUM rating
* GREEEN for a LOW rating

### FarmBuild Components Used
TBA

### Benefits
The visualisation of a risk rating based on paddocks allows landowners to take preventative measures, such as moving herds to lower risked paddocks, potentially avoiding the onset of the syndtome.

###Inputs
The risk rating takes in two soil parameters and one climate parameter as follows:

* Phosphorus Buffer Index (PBI)
* Potassium (Colwell)
* Daily Cloudiness rated as HIGH, MEDIUM or LOW

###Outputs
There a single output, being a numerical risk rating for downer cow syndrome as follows:

* 1 for a LOW  risk rating
* 2 for a MEDIUM risk rating
* 3 for a HIGH risk rating
